# blog.nazrulhisham.net

As part of improving my digital & online presence, I've decided to build myself a new blog and host it on my longstanding personal domain [blog.nazrulhisham.net](http://blog.nazrulhisham.net).

My old blog, [hello.nazrulhisham.net](http://hello.nazrulhisham.net/), that was built on top of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) circa 2014, will be decommissioned soon. 

Archive posts and codes are available for reference at [github/lumachroma/fantastik](https://github.com/lumachroma/fantastik).


## Overview

> Coming soon...


## Running Locally

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/lumachroma/blog.nazrulhisham.net.git
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

Create a `.env.local` file similar to [`.env.example`](#).


## Built Using
