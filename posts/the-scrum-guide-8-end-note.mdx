## End Note

Scrum is free and offered in this Guide.
The Scrum framework, as outlined herein, is immutable.
While implementing only parts of Scrum is possible, the result is not Scrum.
Scrum exists only in its entirety and functions well as a container for other techniques, methodologies, and practices.

### Acknowledgements

##### People
Of the thousands of people who have contributed to Scrum, we should single out those who were instrumental at the start: 
*Jeff Sutherland* worked with *Jeff McKenna* and *John Scumniotales*, and *Ken Schwaber* worked with *Mike Smith* and *Chris Martin*, and all of them worked together.
Many others contributed in the ensuing years and without their help Scrum would not be refined as it is today.

##### Scrum Guide History
Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland first co-presented Scrum at the OOPSLA Conference in 1995.
It essentially documented the learning that Ken and Jeff gained over the previous few years and made public the first formal definition of Scrum.

The Scrum Guide documents Scrum as developed, evolved, and sustained for 30-plus years by Jeff Sutherland and Ken Schwaber.
Other sources provide patterns, processes, and insights that complement the Scrum framework.
These may increase productivity, value, creativity, and satisfaction with theresults.

The complete history of Scrum is described elsewhere.
To honor the first places where it was tried and proven, we recognize Individual Inc., Newspage, Fidelity Investments, and IDX (now GE Medical).
