## Scrum Theory

Scrum is founded on empiricism and lean thinking.
Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is observed.
Lean thinking reduces waste and focuses on the essentials.

Scrum employs an iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and to control risk.
Scrum engages groups of people who collectively have all the skills and expertise to do the work and share or acquire such skills as needed.

Scrum combines four formal events for inspection and adaptation within a containing event, the Sprint.
These events work because they implement the empirical Scrum pillars of transparency, inspection, and adaptation.

###  Transparency

The emergent process and work must be visible to those performing the work as well as those receiving the work.
With Scrum, important decisions are based on the perceived state of its three formal artifacts.
Artifacts that have low transparency can lead to decisions that diminish value and increase risk.

Transparency enables inspection. Inspection without transparency is misleading and wasteful.

### Inspection

The Scrum artifacts and the progress toward agreed goals must be inspected frequently and diligently to detect potentially undesirable variances or problems.
To help with inspection, Scrum provides cadence in the form of its five events.

Inspection enables adaptation. Inspection without adaptation is considered pointless. Scrum events are designed to provoke change.

### Adaptation

If any aspects of a process deviate outside acceptable limits or if the resulting product is unacceptable, the process being applied or the materials being produced must be adjusted.
The adjustment must be made as soon as possible to minimize further deviation.

Adaptation becomes more difficult when the people involved are not empowered or self-managing.
A Scrum Team is expected to adapt the moment it learns anything new through inspection.
